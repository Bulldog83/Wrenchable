# Wrenchable
A lightweight, JiJ-able wrench library which aims to make wrenches compatible between mods.

To include it in your project, add this to your build.gradle:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
dependencies {
    modImplementation 'com.github.Zundrel:wrenchable:LATEST'
    include 'com.github.Zundrel:wrenchable:LATEST'
}
```
Where `LATEST` is the latest tag under the releases tab.
